<br />

### The Malaysia License Plate follows the "Sxx ####" **format**:
- 'S' is state prefix
- 'x' is the alphabetical sequences
- '#' is the number sequences
- The font type can be any easy to read typeface such as Arial Bold and Charles Wright
<br />

### However, there are several **exceptions** on the format where:
- No leading 0 in number sequences
- The alphabetical number, 'O' and 'I' is omitted due to similiar with number 0 and 1
- The alphabetical number, 'Z' is omitted to reserved for Malaysian military used 
<br />

### Commemorative Plates
